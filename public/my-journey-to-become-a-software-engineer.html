        <h1>My Journey To Become A Software Engineer</h1>

        <h2>Unraveling the Digital Universe at 9</h2>

        <p>
          In 2002, when I was nine years old, I stepped into TEC Sri Lanka, a place filled with computers and cutting
          edge technology. It felt like entering a world! Little did I know then that this experience would ignite my
          passion, for all things related to computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back in those days computers seemed magical. They had the power to perform tasks! At TEC Sri Lanka I didn't
          just learn how to type or use a mouse, I delved deeper. Discovered the art of communicating with these
          machines. I acquired skills in crafting websites using HTML and CSS and even grasped the fundamentals of
          programming. It was like unlocking the language of technology!
        </p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./images/30604187_1926349017675514_6999401850311016448_n.jpg" alt="a GW BASIC Lesson" />

        </div>
        <p>
          By the time I turned fifteen my collection of certificates showcased my mastery of computer skills. However,
          it wasn't about achieving certifications, it was about the thrill of seeing my code come to life solving
          problems through thinking and realizing that technology opened endless possibilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the beginning of my journey. The simple code that captivated me at nine has evolved into software
          systems while basic web pages have transformed into applications. My initial curiosity has grown into a
          determination to create solutions that positively impact people's lives.
        </p>

        <h2>Adventures in Dad's Computer Lab</h2>
        <p>
          My after-school spot was a bit different - my dad's school computer lab. Since we didn't have a computer at
          home, I spent about three to four years turning that lab into my own tech haven. From sixth to eighth grade,
          it felt like my second home. Sure, games were fun, but what really got me going was coding. I loved messing
          around with Visual Basic 6.0, creating simple stuff like calculators and animations. Even though they were
          basic, seeing my code actually work was so exciting!
        </p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./images/computer_lab.jpeg" alt="Old computer lab in 2000s" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Not having a computer at home forced me to get creative. I absorbed as much as I could in the lab, then wrote
          down notes and code in my notebooks, recreating everything later on borrowed computers. It was a slow process,
          but it taught me to be really resourceful and great at problem-solving! The lab might not have been fancy, but
          it's where my passion for coding really blossomed. It taught me more than just technical skills, it showed me
          the importance of determination, resourcefulness, and always being eager to learn - qualities that still come
          in handy as a software engineer today.
        </p>

        <h2>The Arrival of My First Computer</h2>
        <p>
          Ah, the struggle of relying on borrowed computers! But then, imagine this! A gleaming new computer proudly
          displayed in our living room, thanks to my amazing dad! It wasn't just any computer, it was a gateway to a
          whole new world of digital adventures. No more limitations of the school lab, this was our own digital haven,
          shared with my brother, who was just as tech-savvy.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="./images/my-first-computer.jpeg" alt="My first computer" />
        </div>
        <p>
          But let's be honest, were we all about serious stuff like spreadsheets and coding? Not really! Like most kids,
          we were all about the games. We dove headfirst into classics like Age of Empires, Counter-Strike, and Need for
          Speed, spending endless hours competing (and sometimes teaming up!). Those virtual worlds weren't just for
          fun, they were moments of bonding, sparking friendly competition and lots of laughter.
        </p>

        <h2>Invested more in education</h2>
        <p>
          It wasn't just about playing games, they opened the door to my growing curiosity about technology. Eager to
          learn more, I pursued higher education during my GCE A/L years, opting for an interesting mix of subjects: IT,
          Economics, and History.
        </p>

        <p>
          But my quest for knowledge didn't end there. While juggling my GCE A/L studies, I delved deeper into the
          practical side of technology with the NCC Education international diploma in computing. This program gave me
          hands-on experience with programming languages, web development, and networking principles. Mixing theory with
          practice was key. GCE A/L provided the groundwork, and the NCC diploma honed my technical skills and enriched
          my understanding of core computing concepts. It was like laying the foundation and then mastering it in
          real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking back on it now, the combination of both academic paths proved incredibly valuable. My diverse
          background gave me a unique perspective, turning me into more than just a skilled coder. I became someone who
          could not only write code but also analyze, explain, and put technology into context. This broad understanding
          became a significant asset in my future career as a software engineer.
        </p>

        <h2>Campus years</h2>
        <p>
          Life isn't always a clear-cut path, sometimes it's a winding road full of unexpected turns. My journey through
          GCE A/L had its fair share of uphill battles, but amidst the struggle, it opened doors to a realm of new
          possibilities. Together with a friend, we dared to take on a new challenge - pursuing a software engineering
          degree at SLIIT, a beacon of opportunity in Sri Lanka's educational landscape.
        </p>
        <div class="image">

        </div>
        <p>
          While GCE A/L may not have showcased my brightest academic moments, it served as a crucible of resilience,
          teaching me invaluable lessons in determination, adaptability, and courage. During those tough times, I
          discovered inner strengths I never knew I had, pushing me onward to new and unfamiliar paths.
        </p>

        <p>
          SLIIT, though, was like a whole new world opening up before me. It wasn't merely a campus, it was a crucible
          of transformation, sculpted to shape aspiring software engineers into adept innovators. Here, I immersed
          myself in the complex algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and the ever-evolving art of
          software design. Each new concept, each line of code, was a portal to uncharted realms of possibility, each
          keystroke a step closer to unlocking the secrets of the digital universe.

          I discovered the true essence of software engineering - the thrill of seeing lines of code spring to life, the
          joy of unraveling complex problems with elegant solutions, and the profound satisfaction of creating something
          meaningful that transcended the virtual realm.
        </p>

        <p>
          Certainly, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Wrestling with tricky algorithms, debugging errors in my code, and
          burning the midnight oil to meet project deadlines became familiar companions on my journey. But with each
          hurdle, I emerged more resilient, more resourceful, and even more determined to carve out my path in the world
          of coding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflecting on my time at SLIIT, I realize it was a crucible of growth for me. It not only honed my technical
