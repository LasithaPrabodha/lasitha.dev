      <h1>Understanding the Singleton Pattern & when to use it, or do we really need to?</h1>

      <p>
        In this article, I will dive into understanding what the Singleton Pattern is and let's check whether it's
        really worth it. I will be using C# as our main language to give you examples because (insert something funny).
      </p>

      <h2>So, what exactly is Singleton Pattern?</h2>

      <p>
        Let's imagine you're working on a project where you need just one copy of a class, accessible from anywhere in
        your code. That's what the Singleton Pattern is all about; ensuring there's only one instance of a class in
        charge of a specific task. This way, you maintain order and prevent chaos by avoiding duplicate instances and
        conflicting operations.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="../images/blogs/singleton-meme-some-hero.webp" alt="There can be only one... initialization" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Singleton Pattern is one of the simplest design patterns and probably the most widely used design pattern.
        Sometimes it is used in scenarios where it is not required. In such cases, the disadvantages of using it
        outweighs the advantages what it provides.
      </p>
      <h2>But why would we need such a pattern?</h2>
      <p>
        Take managing a database connection or overseeing access to a shared resource like a logging system or a
        configuration manager as examples. Having multiple instances in these scenarios could spell trouble, leading to
        wasted resources or messy outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>Enough with the theory, let's look into a real-world scenario in C# where we apply the Singleton Pattern</p>

      <p>
        We have a class named <code>DBManager</code>, tasked with handling database connections across our application.
        It's crucial to have just one <code>DBManager</code> instance to avoid resource wastage and potential connection
        issues.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/LasithaPrabodha/81c2833179f608ba695a04de13499418.js"></script>

      <p>
        The <code>DBManager</code> class keeps its constructor private so that there's no external initialization. The
        <code>Instance</code>
        property is in charge of managing the singleton instance. We provide the access for our instance by setting it
        up as a static property. Whenever we need to deal with the database in our app we just need to make quick call
        with <code>DBManager.Instance.Connect()</code> to gets us connected, and
        <code>DBManager.Instance.Disconnect()</code> tidies things up when we're done. It's a straightforward way to
        keep our database tasks consistent and smooth across the application.
      </p>

      <p>We can see that this pattern addresses two problems.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure that a class has just a single instance.</li>
        <li>Provide a global access point to that instance.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        However, it's actually not as nice as it sounds, which is why I believe the Singleton pattern is often
        considered problematic or 'evil'.
      </p>

      <h2>What's the issue with Global Instances?</h2>
      <p>Hmm, global access? So now everyone can access it? 🤔</p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="../images/blogs/singleton-meme-friends.webp" alt="A friends meme" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The Singleton Pattern can be a <strong>double-edged sword</strong> when it comes to global instances. While it
        offers a convenient way to manage single instances of classes, it also presents us some challenges.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          With global access to a single instance, different parts of your code become tightly coupled with it. This
          means changes to the singleton class can ripple throughout your codebase, making maintenance more complicated.
          I bet you won't need that when you approach a release date.
        </li>
        <li>
          By using global instances, You hide your application's dependencies in your code instead of exposing them
          through the interfaces and injecting them wherever is needed. This will decrease testability and flexibility
          while increasing complexity and difficulty in debugging.
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing code reliant on global singletons is tough. The hidden dependencies and tight coupling make it tricky
          to isolate and test components independently.
        </li>
        <li>
          As your codebase grows, the rigidness of global singletons can limit scalability. Refactoring or adding new
          features becomes more challenging.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>I remember my father once said,</p>

      <p class="quote">
        <i>Avoid using global variables or instances, son. </i>
      </p>

      <p>Maybe he knew I would reach this stage someday. :></p>

      <h2>Violation Of SOLID Principles</h2>
      <p>Let's see how the Singleton Pattern cost us when held up to SOLID principles. It's pretty bad actually.</p>

      <h3>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>
      <p>
        The Singleton Pattern's primary responsibility is to ensure a single instance of a class. However, it often
        takes on additional responsibilities, such as managing global state or serving as a global access point.
      </p>
      <p>
        When several threads request access to one instance; singleton should take responsibility for dispatching data
        to each request in threads by using locks to prevent <strong>Race-Condition</strong> or handling read and write
        to deliver valid data.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is just the beginning. As time goes by, new responsibilities will be added to the singleton. You end up
        with a class that nearly does anything. This violates the SRP by causing the class to have multiple reasons to
        change.
      </p>

      <h3>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h3>

      <p>
        The Singleton Pattern can be challenging to extend or modify without altering its core implementation. Since the
        class controls its own instantiation, making changes to accommodate new requirements can be tricky without
        modifying the class directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        A class needs to allow inheritance in order to qualify as “open”. Inheritance is an “is-a” relationship. Because
        of the “is-a” relationship, instances of the child class are also instances of the parent class if you inherit
        from a singleton class. This means that you may end up with numerous instances of the singleton class.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a singleton class prevents inheritance, it is no longer “open”; however, if a singleton class allows
        inheritance, it is “open” for extension, and it can no longer follow the singleton pattern.
      </p>

      <h3>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h3>

      <p>
        According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Wikipedia article</a>,
      </p>

      <p class="quote">
        <i
          >In object-oriented design, the dependency inversion principle is a specific methodology for loosely coupled
          software modules
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Singleton Pattern introduces high coupling between components that rely on the singleton instance. This
        can make it challenging to adhere to the DIP, as components become tightly bound to the Singleton class, making
        it difficult to substitute dependencies or adhere to dependency injection principles.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>TL;DR:</h2>

      <p>
        The Singleton Pattern ensures there's only one instance of a class, accessible globally, but it's a mixed bag.
        While the Singleton Pattern can be a useful tool, it's essential to be mindful of its potential to violate SOLID
        principles, particularly concerning single responsibility and dependency inversion. Careful design and
        consideration are necessary to mitigate these risks and maintain a clean and flexible codebase.
