## "Could you please introduce yourself to us?"

I'm Lasitha Prabodha Weligampola, a software developer with extensive experience in technologies like Angular, React, TypeScript, C#, 
ASP.NET Core, SQL, and Azure. 
During my journey so far I have had the opportunity to work for companies based in Sri Lanka and Norway 
before making my way, to Canada. Throughout my career path I have been actively engaged in developing 
web applications while also guiding other developers and leading teams towards achieving success. 

## New Adventure

When I decided to relocate to Canada and search for employment opportunities I anticipated facing some challenges, 
but I didn't expect just how tough it would be. Despite my experience, I found myself applying to job after job, 
each time adjusting my resume and cover letter to match each jobs requirements. 
Most of the time, I heard nothing back, or I faced rejections.

It felt difficult to stay positive at times, questioning if I was overlooking something or if my skills weren't quite 
fitting into the Canadian job market as I had hoped. Every application felt like a shot in the dark, and after so many, 
it was easy to start feeling like I was just spinning my wheels. But I kept at it because I knew the right job was 
out there somewhere. I just needed only one yes. 

I learned to adapt, kept improving my skills, while trying not to dwell much on the obstacles that came my way.

## The Job Search Journey

When I first started my job search in Canada, 

> I was optimistic. 

Having worked in the tech field for some time now and considering my background and skills, 
I thought it would be a matter of weeks before I found the right role. At the beginning, as a 
full stack developer I felt optimistic that my skills would lead to job opportunities and interviews swiftly.
But after applying to hundreds of job opportunities and receiving either rejections or no responses at all, 
I realized that finding a job in this country was going to be a far more challenging than I had anticipated.

As my initial expectations faded, I realized I needed to change my approach. 
I started fine-tuning my resume and cover letters further by customizing them to match each job description more closely.
Todays job market competition isn't just about sending out resumes; it's also, about networking and building your professional reputation. 
But guess what? 

> That didn't go as planned. 

Due to job-hunting anxiety, my interactions with others started to decline.

However, one interaction that couldn't be avoided was interviews.
I had to focus heavily on improving my interview skills, which was a significant challenge for me. 
At first, talking with assurance during job interviews in a setting proved to be quite challenging for me. 
I made every effort to become more at ease with the procedure. 

## Rejections 

The journey was far from smooth. There were days when the rejections were hard to take, and the 
lack of responses left me wondering if I was doing something wrong. 
Oftentimes, I struggled to articulate my thoughts effectively when feeling nervous. 
Every rejection or non-response felt like a setback. 

During those times of struggle and challenges I always told myself that every obstacle was a chance to grow and learn. 

## What Kept Me Motivated

The job search was tough, but there were a few things that kept me going even when the rejections piled up. 
The first and biggest motivation was my wife. She's been an incredible source of strength for me. Back home, she worked as a software quality assurance engineer, 
but when we moved to Canada, she took on a completely new role, working hard at a restaurant. She tried many months looking for a role in her experienced field, 
but luck was not on her side. Seeing her adapt to such a different environment and work tirelessly to support us was a huge push for me. 
I couldn't stand the thought of sitting at home while she worked her ass off to cover our apartment rent and groceries.

Besides my wife, there were other things that helped me stay motivated. 
To add some organization to my routine and reduce job searching stress, 
I follow a routine where I allocate specific time slots for various tasks throughout the week, 
dedicating 10 hours per week to applying for jobs, another 10 hours to learning something new, and 10 hours to my part-time remote job. 
The rest of my time was filled with college studies, which, thankfully, didn't pose much of a challenge for me. 

After purchasing a domain I decided to share my thoughts on the internet through writing as a means to unwind and distract myself from the pressures of job hunting. 
Each blog post felt like a small accomplishment, giving me a sense of purpose and progress. 
I believe this might have helped me get shortlisted for interviews as well. 

Lastly, I took up some side projects and online courses to keep my skills sharp. 
These activities allowed me to continue learning and stay productive, even when job offers weren't coming in. 

## Changes to My Approach

As I navigated through the job search process, I made several changes to my approach that eventually led to success. 
Initially, I believed that applying to as many positions as possible would increase my chances, but I quickly realized 
that quality mattered more than quantity. I began customizing my resume and cover letters meticulously for each job, 
aligning them with the specific requirements.

You might be thinking this approach has improved my chances of getting noticed, but no. There was no change. 
This led me to take a step back and reflect on my work experiences. I focused on identifying the core skills 
I had gained and how best to express them. 

The key was in,

> simplifying and sharpening my presentation.

I revamped my resume with active language, short sentences, and concise bullet points, five to six key highlights 
per company that showcased my strengths. I trimmed down content from my earliest experiences, as they were too old to be relevant.
I also ensured it was a one-page resume, making it easier for recruiters to quickly grasp my qualifications. 
This streamlined approach made a significant difference.

Another change was my approach to interviews. I invested more time in preparing for each interview by 
researching the companies thoroughly and practicing my responses to common questions. 
I also worked on improving my communication skills to express my thoughts more clearly and confidently. 
This preparation helped me perform better in interviews and left a positive impression on potential employers.

## The Job Offer

The moment I received the job offer was surreal. After months of hard work and persistence, 
it felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. 

> I remember reading the offer letter multiple times just to make sure it was real. 

The reason I decided to take the job offer was because it matched my career aspirations well and provided 
room for development while also reflecting values important to me in its work environment. 
The excitement of embarking on a new chapter in my career, coupled with the deep sense of accomplishment, 
made all the challenges and hard work feel truly worth it.

## Advice to My Fellow Job Seekers

If you're currently, in search of a job my best advice is to stay persistent and keep pushing. 
Finding a job can be quite daunting and discouraging at times. It is crucial to stay persistent and continue striving forward. 
It's often suggested to tailor your job application, for each position you apply for; however it's equally crucial to 
acknowledge when a role matches your expertise and abilities. Instead of being a jack of all trades, consider 
maintaining one strong resume that highlights your core strengths. 

Focus on networking and building connections within your industry. Don't be afraid to ask for feedback. 
It can provide valuable insights for improvement. 
Continuous learning is essential, whether it's honing your skills or gaining a deeper understanding of the job market. 

## Looking Forward

Stepping into this position fills me with hope and a strong sense of purpose. My aim is to excel in my duties 
and make valuable contributions to our team. I'm grateful for the journey that brought me here.

## Closing Thoughts

Reflecting on my experience, I've come to realize that the job search is as much about personal growth as it is about finding the right role. 
The challenges and setbacks along the way are what make the eventual success so rewarding. 
To anyone still searching, I encourage you to stay positive, keep learning, and trust in your journey. 
The right opportunity is out there, you need only one "yes".
