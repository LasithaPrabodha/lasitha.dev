During my interview today, the interviewer asked about a challenge I faced in a past project. I immediately thought of a project where I implemented RowVersioning a few years ago. 
My team lead in Norway even suggested I write a blog post about it at the time. However, I was heavily focused on my plans to immigrate to Canada and it completely slipped my mind. 
So today, I'm going to fulfill my promise.

Managing data consistency is key in applications where multiple users interact with the same data. 
In web apps, you might have seen ETag and If-Match headers alongside a technique called RowVersioning to handle these situations. 
Let's break down how RowVersioning works with these headers and how you can use this in EF Core.

## What is RowVersioning?

RowVersioning is a method for tracking changes to data in a database when multiple users might be making updates at the same time. 
Essentially, it uses a version number or timestamp that updates every time a row changes. 
When you try to update a row, EF Core checks if the version number in the database matches the one you have. 
If they match, your update goes through. If not, it means someone else has made changes since you last saw it, and you'll get a concurrency conflict.


## What are ETag and If-Match Headers?

An ETag (Entity Tag) is a unique identifier that represents a specific version of a resource. 
It's included in the HTTP response headers and helps clients keep track of changes.

The If-Match header comes into play when you're making HTTP requests. 
It allows you to make your request conditional by including the ETag value you've received earlier. 
The server will only process your request if the current ETag matches the one you've provided. 
This helps prevent issues where updates might be lost or conflicts arise because of simultaneous changes.

## Why Use ETag and If-Match Headers?

Using ETag and If-Match headers together with RowVersioning gives you a solid way to handle data conflicts in web applications. 
It ensures that your updates are applied only if the data hasn't been modified since you last checked, helping you avoid overwriting someone else's changes and keeping your data consistent.

## Implementation

This is a production-ready implementation. I'm going to use a custom attribute to do all the dirty work. So, let's go through it step by step and get our hands dirty.

1. Add a RowVersion Property to Your Entity
    Define a property in your entity class to store the version number or timestamp. This property should be of type `byte[]`.

    ```cs
    public class RowVersionBase
    {
        public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; } = null!;
    }

    public class User : RowVersionBase
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public Role Role { get; set; }

        [JsonIgnore]
        public string PasswordHash { get; set; }
    }
    ```
2. Configure the RowVersion Property in the DbContext
    In your `DbContext` class, configure the `RowVersion` property using the Fluent API.

    ```cs
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.Entity<User>()
            .Property(x => x.RowVersion)
            .IsRowVersion();
    }
    ```
3. Include ETag in HTTP Responses
    When returning an entity in an HTTP response, include the ETag header. The ETag value can be the base64-encoded RowVersion property.

    In my solution, I have a scoped service called `ChangeContext` to store the RowVersion value. 
    I will later collect the RowVersion value from that service and assign it to the response headers using an custom `ActionFilterAttribute`. 

    ```cs title="UserService.cs" {7}
    public async Task<UserResponseViewModel> GetById(int id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var user = await GetUser(id, cancellationToken);

        var userVm = _mapper.Map<UserResponseViewModel>(user);

        _changeContext.RowVersion = user.RowVersion;

        return userVm;
    }
    ```
 
    ```cs  title="UseOptimisticConcurrencyAttribute.cs" {12}
    const string ETAG_HEADER = "ETag";

    public UseOptimisticConcurrencyFilter(ChangeContext changeContext)
    {
        this.changeContext = changeContext;
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        if (changeContext.RowVersion != null && context.HttpContext.Request.Method.Equals(HttpMethod.Get.Method))
        {
            context.HttpContext.Response.Headers.Add(ETAG_HEADER, Convert.ToBase64String(changeContext.RowVersion));
        }
    }
    ```

4. Handle If-Match Header in HTTP Requests

    When processing update requests, check the If-Match header to ensure the resource has not been modified. 
    If the If-Match header is not present when called the API, return a 428 Precondition Required response.
    If the ETag values do not match, return a 412 Precondition Failed response.

    
    ```cs title="UseOptimisticConcurrencyAttribute.cs" ins={2, 9-30, 39-43}
    const string ETAG_HEADER = "ETag";
    const string MATCH_HEADER = "If-Match";

    public UseOptimisticConcurrencyFilter(ChangeContext changeContext)
    {
        this.changeContext = changeContext;
    }

    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        var method = context.HttpContext.Request.Method;
        if (method.Equals(HttpMethod.Post.Method) || method.Equals(HttpMethod.Put.Method))
        {
            if (context.HttpContext.Request.Headers.ContainsKey(MATCH_HEADER))
            {
                try
                {
                    changeContext.RowVersion = Convert.FromBase64String(context.HttpContext.Request.Headers[MATCH_HEADER]);
                }
                catch (FormatException)
                {
                    context.Result = new StatusCodeResult(StatusCodes.Status428PreconditionRequired);
                }
            }
            else
            {
                context.Result = new StatusCodeResult(StatusCodes.Status428PreconditionRequired);
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        if (changeContext.RowVersion != null && context.HttpContext.Request.Method.Equals(HttpMethod.Get.Method))
        {
            context.HttpContext.Response.Headers.Add(ETAG_HEADER, Convert.ToBase64String(changeContext.RowVersion));
        }

        if (context.Exception is DbUpdateConcurrencyException)
        {
            context.Result = new StatusCodeResult(StatusCodes.Status412PreconditionFailed);
            context.ExceptionHandled = true;
        }
    }
    ```


## Conclusion

Combining RowVersioning with ETag and If-Match headers is a powerful approach for managing concurrency in web applications with EF Core.
By using ETag to keep track of resource versions and If-Match to make sure updates only go through if the resource hasn't been changed, you can avoid losing updates and keep your data consistent. 
Implementing these techniques in your .NET Core apps will make them more reliable and improve the overall experience for your users.

You can find the prototype project I've developed to  experiment with RowVersioning in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LasithaPrabodha/concurrency-handling/).
